The **Maximum Segment Size** (MSS) is a [[TCP]] Option and sets the largest segment that the local host will accept.
The MSS is usually the link [[Maximum transmission unit]] size minus the 40 bytes of the [[TCP]] and [[IP headers]], but many implementations use segments of **512 or ***536*** **bytes** (it's a maximum, not a demand).
