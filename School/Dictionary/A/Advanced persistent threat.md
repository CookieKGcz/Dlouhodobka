An **advanced persistent threat** (**APT**) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a [[computer network]] and remains undetected for an extended period. In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.
