A **Command and Control attack is** a type of attack that **involves tools to communicate with and control an infected machine or network**. To profit for as long as possible from a malware attack, a hacker needs a covert channel or backdoor between their server and the compromised network or machine.

The cybercriminals server, whether a single machine or a [[Botnet]] of machines, is referred to as the command-and-control server (**C&C**) server or **C2** server.

## How Do Command-and-Control Attacks Work?

For a command-and-control attack to work, the perpetrator must first infect the targeted machine or network with malware via a specific form of cyberattack, such as [[phishing]], [[social engineering]], or [[malvertising]].

An infected computer or device is called a [[zombie]]; and once compromised, the malware establishes communication with the C2 server to acknowledge it is ready to receive commands from the controlling server. Through the established channel, the criminal host can install additional malicious software, extract data, and spread the infection to additional network resources. If able to compromise entire portions of the network, the command-and-control server will essentially control a botnet of infected machines.
