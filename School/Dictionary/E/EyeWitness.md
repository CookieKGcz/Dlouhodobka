#command 
`EyeWitness` can be used to take screenshots of target web applications, fingerprint them, and identify possible default credentials.


Supported - Kali Linux.
It will auto detect the file you give it with the ==-f flag== as either being a text file with URLs on each new line, nmap xml output, or nessus xml output. The --timeout flag is completely optional, and lets you provide the max time to wait when trying to render and screenshot a web page.
